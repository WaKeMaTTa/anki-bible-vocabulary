# Anki Decks : Bible Vocabulary

This deck is a good start if you are interested on learning the main biblical vocabulary.

This deck contains almost 2,000 entries.

The sources for this deck are:

- Bible Reina Valera 1960 [RVR1960] (Spanish)
- Bible New King James Version [NKJV] RVR1960 (English)

I used those versions of the bible because it is what the Holy Spirit tells us to use.

The tools that facilitated this work are:

- [biblegateway.com](https://www.biblegateway.com/)
- [linguee.com](https://www.linguee.com/spanish-english)

Also, I got inspiration from other decks of ankiweb.net

God bless you.

To God be the glory!
